                        <li>Every two seconds someone in the U.S. needs blood.</li>
                        <li>Approximately 36,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the U.S.</li>
                        <li>Nearly 7,000 units of platelets and 10,000 units of plasma are needed daily in the U.S.</li>
                        <li>Nearly 21 million blood components are transfused each year in the U.S.</li>
                        <li>The average red blood cell transfusion is approximately 3 pints.</li>
                        <li>The blood type most often requested by hospitals is type O.</li>
                        <li>The blood used in an emergency is already on the shelves before the event occurs.</li>
                        <li>It is estimated that sickle cell disease affects 90,000 to 100,000 people in the U.S. About 1,000
                            babies are born with the disease each year. Sickle cell patients can require frequent blood transfusions
                            throughout their lives.
                            <li>According to the American Cancer Society, more than 1.69 million people are expected to be diagnosed
                                with cancer in 2017. Many of them will need blood, sometimes daily, during their chemotherapy
                                treatment.</li>
                            <li>A single car accident victim can require as many as 100 pints of blood.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The number of whole blood and red blood cell units collected in the U.S. in a year: 13.6 million</li>
                        <li>The number of blood donors in the U.S. in a year: 6.8 million</li>
                        <li>Although an estimated 38 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate blood at any given
                            time, less than 10 percent of that eligible population actually do each year.</li>
                        <li>Blood cannot be manufactured – it can only come from generous donors.</li>
                        <li>Type O negative blood (red cells) can be transfused to patients of all blood types. It is always
                            in great demand and often in short supply.</li>
                        <li>Type AB positive plasma can be transfused to patients of all other blood types. AB plasma is also
                            usually in short supply.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Donating blood is a safe process. A sterile needle is used only once for each donor and then discarded.</li>
                        <li>Blood donation is a simple four-step process: registration, medical history&nbsp;and&nbsp;mini-physical,
                            donation and refreshments.</li>
                        <li>Every blood donor is given a mini-physical, checking the donor's temperature, blood pressure, pulse
                            and&nbsp;hemoglobin to ensure it is safe for the donor to give blood.</li>
                        <li>The actual blood donation typically takes less than 10-12 minutes. The entire process, from the time
                            you arrive to the time you leave, takes about an hour and 15 minutes.Donors may save time by
                            completing a
                            <a href="http://redcrossblood.org/rapidpass">RapidPass</a> on the day of their donation prior to arriving at the blood drive.</li>
                        <li>The average adult has about 10 pints of blood in his body. Roughly 1 pint is given during a donation.</li>
                        <li>A healthy donor may donate red blood cells every 56 days or Power Red&nbsp;every 112 days.</li>
                        <li>A healthy donor may donate platelets as few as&nbsp;7 days apart, but a maximum of 24 times a year.</li>
                        <li>All donated blood is tested for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and other infectious diseases before
                            it can be released to hospitals.</li>
                        <li>Information you give to the American Red Cross during the donation process is confidential. It may
                            not be released without your permission except as directed by law.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There are four types of transfusable products that can be derived from blood: red cells, platelets,
                            plasma and cryoprecipitate. Typically,&nbsp;two or three of these are produced from a pint of
                            donated whole blood.</li>
                        <li>A single donation can potentially help more than one patient.</li>
                        <li>Donors can give either whole blood or specific blood components only. The process of donating specific
                            blood components – red cells, plasma or platelets – is called apheresis.</li>
                        <li>One transfusion dose of platelets can be obtained through one apheresis donation of platelets or
                            by combining the platelets derived from&nbsp;five whole blood donations.</li>
                        <li>Most donated red blood cells must be used within 42 days of collection.</li>
                        <li>Donated platelets must be used within&nbsp;five days of collection –&nbsp;new donations are constantly
                            needed.</li>
                        <li>Plasma and cryoprecipitate are stored in frozen state and can be used for up to one year after collection.</li>
                        <li>Healthy bone marrow makes a constant supply of red cells, plasma and platelets. The body will replenish
                            the elements given during a blood donation – some in a matter of hours and others in a matter
                            of weeks.</li>
